## Code Conventions and Housekeeping

None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They
can also be added after the original pull
request but before a merge.

* Use the project code format conventions. Import `XXXX.xml` from the root of
  the project if you are using Eclipse. Checkstyle configuration is available 
  at `XXXX.xml`
* Make sure all new .java files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at
  least an @author tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on 
  what the class is for.
* Add the ASF license header comment to all new .java files (copy from existing 
  files in the project)
* Add yourself as an @author to the .java files that you modify substantially
  (more than cosmetic changes).
* A few unit tests would help a lot as well - someone has to do it.
* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current
  master (or other target branch in the main project).
